Calculating and drawing nucleon-pairing effects in atomic nuclei, including binding energy, one-particle and two-particles separation energy(two free nucleons), alpha separation energy(Q-value) and pairing gaps of nn, pp and np pairs across nuclide chart and for an isotope/isotone/isodiapher chain, CERN root macros using AME2020 data.
